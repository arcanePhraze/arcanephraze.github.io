## Updates:
### 01-05-2025 - The end of the beginning (of a two-year long hiatus)
Happy New Year to all! I'm so looking forward to 202--\
(Wait, what do you mean it's 2025..? What have we been doing for the last year and some?!)

Sorry for not uploading for the ENTIRETY OF 2024. Life got a little hectic and I got burned out big time.

I told myself at the end of 2024: "I'm going to upload like I should in 2025."\
Then I woke up Sunday morning going "Oh crap, I need to upload like I should TODAY."\
So with this update comes a new page and a new promise to upload more often..\
..as long as it can align with my new work/life balance.\
I hope the future for Razzomania is a bright one,\
and every day I didn't or don't upload is a reminder\
that I need to commit to the things I want to accomplish in life.\
I sincerely promise I won't abandon Raz or Phraze again! Seriously! Honest! 100%! Guaranteed! Or your money back!\
On another note I probably need to work a way to archive these updates..\
..and find another social media platform to upload to.\
And update Tumblr. (My poor Tumblr page..)
