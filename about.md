# About

## What *is* Razzomania?
Razzomania is a web-based gag comic created by arcanePhraze.

## What is Razzomania about?

Razzomania features the varied adventures of its titular character, *Raz the Razzo*.

Raz is a hyperactive individual of the mysterious species "Razzo".\
Their fantastical biology grants them various abilities, making them a force to be reckoned with.\
Young and curious, Raz sets out to discover all he can about life outside the void.\
Despite their destructive potential, Raz is *usually* well-tempered...

As Raz ventures far and wide, *Phraze* ------ a deity banished to the void ------ is constantly in hot pursuit of their creation in an attempt to put a stop to their "world-breaking mistake".

Will Phraze ever catch Raz? Will Raz ever escape Phraze's watchful eye?\
That's what Razzomania is all about!
